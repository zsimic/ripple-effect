## Testing

Tests live in `tests/` and use the `cli` fixture from `runez.conftest` to
drive the real CLI entry point. Style guide:

- **Default to high-level CLI tests.** Drive tests through `cli.run(...)` and
  assert against `cli.succeeded` / `cli.failed` and `cli.logged.stdout`.
  Reach for module-level tests of internals only when there's a specific
  reason a case can't be exercised through the CLI — narrow tests pin
  internal shapes and tend to break on refactors even when behaviour is
  unchanged.
- **The `cli` fixture creates and `cd`-s into a per-test temp folder** (and
  cleans it up). Write files inside the test body with relative paths — e.g.
  `runez.write("sample.yml", ...)` — and `os.getcwd()` is that temp folder.
- **Don't pair `cli` with `temp_folder`.** The `temp_folder` fixture is
  redundant when `cli` is in use.
- **Use coverage to find gaps, not to drive tests up-front.** Toward the end
  of a feature run `tox` (which feeds into `tox -e coverage`) to see which
  branches haven't been exercised, and add high-level CLI cases to cover
  them.

Example:

```python
import runez


def test_minimal_valid_config(cli):
    runez.write(
        "sample.yml",
        """
upstream: ~/github/runez
downstream-projects:
  - .
""",
        logger=None,
    )
    cli.run("-c", "sample.yml", "show")
    assert cli.succeeded
    assert "1 downstream project:" in cli.logged.stdout
```

## Style

We aim for readability and simplicity over ceremony. A few project preferences
on top of the standard ruff lint rules:

- **No leading `_` by default on module-level names.** Plain `foo` reads
  better than `_foo`. A leading `_` is a real signal — "called only from
  this module / class, not part of the surface anyone else should reach
  for" — so use it when that's genuinely true and worth communicating, but
  don't default to it.
- **Prefer simple containers for small constant collections.** Use a `tuple`
  for a fixed list of (say) ≤ 10 items rather than `frozenset`. Membership
  testing with `if k not in TUPLE` is fine at this scale; the perf
  difference doesn't matter and `tuple` reads plainer. Reach for
  `set`/`frozenset` only when you actually need set semantics on a hot path.
- **Docstrings on every public function and class.** One-line numpy style
  (see `[tool.ruff.lint.pydocstyle] convention = "numpy"`).

## Architecture

See `SPEC.md` for the config format and execution model, and `PLAN.md` for
working progress.

- **`src/ripple_effect/cli.py`** — click entry point: group command with
  `show`, `prepare`, `run` subcommands. `--config` flag / `RIPPLE_CONFIG`
  env var / `ripple-effect.yml` default. Loads a `RippleSpec` into
  `ctx.obj`.
- **`src/ripple_effect/model.py`** — all domain objects: `RippleSpec`,
  `UpstreamLocalized`, `DownstreamLocalized`, `DownstreamGroup`, `ProjectRef`,
  `VirtualEnv`, `ProjectSettings`, `Outcome`, and the test command handlers
  (`RunWith` base, `RunWithPytest`, `RunWithTox`, see "Test commands" in `SPEC.md`).
  Each class owns its own prepare/run behaviour.
  `RippleSpec` validates the whole config when loading it (see "Validation" in
  `SPEC.md`).

## TODOs

- **Detect `source-ref` changes for URL checkouts.** Currently if a URL
  entry changes (e.g. branch added/changed: `foo.git` → `foo.git@main`),
  `_clone_or_update()` does a `fetch + reset` on the existing clone without
  knowing the target branch changed. The checkout silently stays on
  whatever branch it was on.

  Proposed fix: write the `source-ref` value to a small sentinel file
  alongside each URL checkout (e.g. `proving-grounds/name/.ripple-source-ref`).
  On the next run, compare the stored value with the current config. If they
  differ, `rm -rf` the checkout and let `prepare()` do a fresh `git clone`.
  Applicable only to URL refs (`.is_local` is False) — local folder refs are
  used as-is and need no tracking.
